In this folder you will find my Phd thesis. In the thesis, I deal with different types of algebraic varieties and use combinatorics to prove statements about them. Most of the varieties apearing there are toric, thus they naturally come up with a combinatorial structure. In different chapters you can find results about varieties associated to phylogenetic trees and matroids. In the last chapter are computation of intersection products in the space of complete quadrics which lead to a lot of interesting connections to ML-degree of linear concentration model and degree of semidefinite programming.
